  "I am interested in growing as a researcher and a practitioner in I-O Psychology (a.k.a. OB, HRM). I have graduated from University of California San Diego with a B.S. degree in Psychology. I am planning to study at London School of Economics for my MSc. degree in Human Resources and Organization. In the past, I studied employee well-being in a cross-cultural context. I am open to all types of IO-related projects (research or otherwise). I like making data-driven decisions and approach new challenges with a “scientific” mindset (testable hypothesis is always at the back of my mind). On a more personal note, I am an “efficiency-freak” who loves to automate everything in my life.";
